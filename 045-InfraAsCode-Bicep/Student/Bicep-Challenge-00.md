## Introduction

A smart cloud solution architect always has the right tools in their toolbox.

## Description

In this challenge, we'll be setting up all the tools we will need to complete our challenges.

- Install the recommended toolset:
  - An [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
  - _optional and not required_ [Windows Subsystem for Linux (Windows only)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install)
  - [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
    - Must be at least version 2.20.x
    - **NOTE:** If installing on a Windows workstation, install into the Windows Subsystem for Linux environment using the installation instructions for Linux.
    - **NOTE:** If youâ€™re running into issues running Azure CLI command on Windows, you may need to disable your vpn
    - [Azure CLI Bicep extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install#azure-cli)
  - [PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)
  - [PowerShell Cmdlets for Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Bicep plugin for VS Code
    - [Bicep VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep)
    - [Azure Resource Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureresourcegroups) _optional, but very useful_
  - [Bicep CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install)
  ]

    AzureCLI version 2.20 and higher should include the Bicep CLI tools. If you are using PowerShell, you must follow the instructions at this link to install the Bicep CLI.

**NOTE:** You can complete all of the challenges with the Azure Cloud Shell! However, be a good cloud architect and make sure you have experience installing the tools locally.  Also, it's your choice whether to use the Azure CLI or the Azure Powershell Cmdlets.

## Success Criteria

1. Running `az --version` shows the version of your Azure CLI
1. Visual Studio Code and Bicep tools are installed.
